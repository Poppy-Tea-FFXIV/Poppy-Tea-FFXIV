- 👋 Hi, I’m @Poppy-Tea-FFXIV
- 👀 I’m making 3d models and materials for a friend's project
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to do the above better
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing because I'm already doing the above
- 📫 How to reach me: I'm a misanthropic gremlin hiding behind a thin veneer of social acceptability, so best not to.
